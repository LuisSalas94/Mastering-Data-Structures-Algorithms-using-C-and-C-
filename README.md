You may be new to Data Structure or you have already Studied and Implemented Data Structures but still you feel you need to learn more about Data Structure in detail so that it helps you solve challenging problems and used Data Structure efficiently.


This 53 hours of course covers each topic in greater details, every topic is covered on Whiteboard which will improve your Problem Solving and Analytical Skills. Every Data Structure is discussed, analysed and implemented with a Practical line-by-line coding.

Source code for all Programs is available for you to download



About Instructor

I am the Instructor of this course, I have been teaching this course to university students for a long period of time, I know the pulse of students very well, I know how to present the topic so that itâ€™s easy to grasp for students.

I know how to use White board to explain the topic and also to make it memorable. Remembering the thing and using them in right place is more important than just understanding the topic.
